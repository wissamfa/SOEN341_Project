
## Coding Style: 

The team used a specfic coding style when we wrote the code. For example, the brackets for each function or if/while 
statements should start and end on the same vertical line. This also applies for the HTML tags. 

Ex: <div>
        <p>
        </p>
    </div>

Another coding style we used was anything inside the HTML tags or the if/while statemtns of the functions, must be 
indented an extra tab space. The example above shows how the <p> tag was indented because it is inside the <div> tag
 

## Naming Convention: 

The team used the C-style naming convention when writing the code. This means that when we created a variable or a
function, the name of the variable or function ( if it consisted of 2 or more words ) was separated by and "_"

Ex: the get posts function was called as " get_function() "
